	<h2 class="section-hed">Words from the Managing Director</h2>

	<p>TRM was started from a concept that I had, and a mission that I felt strongly about, for the problems encountered by many injured workers that I had worked with in the past, especially at the Rehabilitation Clinic of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I could truly feel the problems and frustrations of not only the workers, but also the health care providers, employers and the insurers, from the lack of a good system for managing various aspect of work injuries including physical, psycho-social and occupational.</p>

	<p>We are constantly introducing more facets to our wide range of services, so that we can provide even better management for the injured workers. I must be honest to say that we are learning while we manage the injured worker.</p>
